# Pneumonia-Detection

# ⇒ It is a Web App used to classify the x-ray Image as Normal Or Pneumonia

→ Pneumonia is one amongst the most happening diseases all around and requires proper diagnosis at an early stage. A huge number of children die every year due to pneumonia all over the world. According to the latest estimation Pneumonia kills more children than any other infectious disease, claiming the lives of over 8,00,000 children under the age of five. The image processing would help better for prior diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, pneumonia etc. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely used in image processing. The diagnosis of pneumonia can be achieved by using the X-ray images of the chest. This diagnosis is done by considering the factor of having cloud kind of formation on X-ray image. Hence, artificial intelligence-based systems are required.

→ Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs. It is provoked by the agents such as Bacteria, viruses, and fungi. 

→ The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs of lungs, called alveoli . The alveoli are filled with fluid or pus, which makes the person feel difficulty in breathing. 

→ Detection and treatment of pneumonia can reduce mortality rates. Pneumonia is a life threatening and dangerous disease which affects over millions of human beings. 

→ Accurate and fat diagnosis of pneumonia is must to save human life. Deep learning algorithms based on Convolutional neural network have become the common choice for image classifications.
